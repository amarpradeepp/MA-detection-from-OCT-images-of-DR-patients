# Micronaneurysm-detection-from-retina-of-patients-diagnosed-with-Diabetic-Retinopathy

Using OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images of retina, we were able to used edge detection method to identify and detect microaneurysms in retina of DR patients.
The code contains image outputs at multiple levels of morphological operations performed on the inmage.
I have attached a sample image for understanding the implementation.
Hough transform might provide to be useful for further implementation and for obtaining more accurate outputs for other images as well.
